My solution of coding-bat problems (Java)

Here you can find the solution of all codingbat problem (java) => https://codingbat.com/

1. I have written my own logic
2. In recursion section I wrote the iterative way for each and every problem.

# steps to run the program 
1. Download and setup the eclipse
2. Open this repository using github-desktop (or you can download the whle code using command line)
3. Import the project into eclipse
4. I didn't add main method => To run the particuler method
	
	â€¢	Write main method in the class
	
	â€¢	Make the object of the class
	
	â€¢	call the method using class object with appropriate parameters

# tip for recurison problems
While solving the recursion section, I got one conclusion, If you have very less hands-on on recursion  problems (same thing is happened to me ðŸ™‚) then try to resolve the same problem by while loop, it will be very easy for you (In most of cases).
